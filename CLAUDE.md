# OpenDAP Desktop

OpenDAP Desktop: the desktop app for everything you can do with an OpenDAP, from a casual user's first sync to advanced development. Written in Rust.

Part of [OpenDAP](https://github.com/opendap-project). This repository is open source.

## Working here

- Write everything in English: code, docs, commit messages.
- Record only information the maintainers confirmed. Do not infer specs, numbers or wording.
- Project context is in `docs/`: requirements in `docs/requirements/`. Read them before changing anything; update them with the `/opendap:requirement` and `/opendap:adr` skills.
- Licensing follows REUSE (`REUSE.toml`, `LICENSES/`). After adding files or folders, run the `/opendap:license-check` skill.
- Do not duplicate logic the `opendap` CLI already has: both build on one shared core and domain model.
